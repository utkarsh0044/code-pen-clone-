CodePen is an online community and development environment where developers can write and share code snippets, web pages, and front-end web development projects. It was created in 2012 by three developers, Alex Vazquez, Tim Sabat, and Chris Coyier.

CodePen allows developers to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and see the results in real-time. It also supports preprocessors like Sass and LESS, and libraries and frameworks like React and Vue.js.

Users can create their own CodePen projects or collaborate with others by forking and remixing existing projects. They can also share their projects with others through social media, embedded links, or by publishing to the CodePen community.

CodePen offers a free plan and a paid plan with additional features like asset hosting, private projects, and team collaboration. It is a popular tool among front-end developers for prototyping, sharing, and learning.
